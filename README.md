This was a challenge at Neuefische Traineeship to be more familiar with using MongoDB Atlas and it's connection process with Next.js

If you open the live preview https://mongoose-with-next.vercel.app/ you'll see data that has been fetched from the DB and been sorted.

I had to use mongoose to set up a Schema, model and fetch request.
